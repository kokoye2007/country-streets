I came across Evgeny Arbatov’s article “How many streets are in Singapore?”
(https://medium.com/@arbatov/how-many-streets-are-in-singapore-ad7a08b47d87)
and the accompanying repository (https://github.com/evgeniyarbatov/singapore-streets/),
which inspired this project.

I’ve been experimenting with additional regions — Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand,
Myanmar, and GCC states — and updated the Makefile to better support Asia,
then generalized it for global use.

I also added a Dockerfile and a countries list to make running the pipeline
easier.
